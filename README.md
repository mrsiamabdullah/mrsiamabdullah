### Front End Developer
Developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I love tech and entrepreneurship, always up for new challenges.

I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React, and Next.js. I also work with WordPress, Shopify, and create user-friendly websites.

I'm currently working on projects, learning from online courses, and reading books to expand my knowledge.
